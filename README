This is a very simple HTTP server.

It's written in C++ as an educational experiment. Uses asynchronous IO and mulitplexes tasks across multiple threads.

Build using KQueue, so it probably only works on OS/X. At least it's only been tested on an old version of OS/X. Overall very incomplete (currently only supports GET requests, to start with). Probably has massive security holes.

To compile: build.sh
